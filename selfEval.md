# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
I know I need to find balance in my time management I will get caught up in something and forget to move on like hyper focusing. I just need to be more aware set alarms for myself. 
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
A function is a super power that allows you to save time by customizing your own ability that can be used multiple times with different information but with similiar outcomes. 
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
Arguments are the actual data that will be placed in the code block. Parameters are the place holders that save the place of the actual data. 
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
The topic that I discussed with my small group was the function that included strings and mathmatic equations as it was different than other examples.
